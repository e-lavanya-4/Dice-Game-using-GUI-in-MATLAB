# Dice-Game-using-GUI-in-MATLAB
This project is a dice game which has been constructed using Graphical Use Interface (GUI) in MATLAB. The procedure of the game is that the user enters any digit of his choice from 1 to 6. The program of the game automatically rolls the dice and obtains a number. If the number entered by the user is same as the number obtained by the program, the user wins. Otherwise he loses the game.
The program makes use of several inbuilt and user defined functions like-
•	Struct()
•	openingFcn()
•	outputFcn()
•	callback()
•	createFcn()
•	get()
For creating the GUI, we have used the following components-
•	Edit box
•	Text box
•	Push button
•	Axes

1.	The title of the game, “ DICE GAME “ is displayed in a static text box and has the tag of text 3. 
2.	The button,” CLICK”  is a pushbutton and has the tag of pushbutton 1. This button is used to start the game
3.	The result box, which displays whether we have won or lost, is a text box with tag text 4.
4.	The input box, where the user inputs a number of their choice is an edit box with tag, edit 2.
5.	The output box, which displays the number obtained by the program by rolling the dice is an edit box with tag, edit 1.
6.	We have made an axes, and on that we have displayed the image of a dice.
